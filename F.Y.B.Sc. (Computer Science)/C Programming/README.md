# C Programming Assignments

This repository contains a series of programming assignments aimed at demonstrating various concepts in programming using the C language. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of C programming to help you build a strong foundation in this language.

## [Assignment 1: Data Types and Simple Operators](Exercise%201)

- Objective: Demonstrate the use of data types and simple operators (expressions).
- Contents: C code showcasing data type usage and simple arithmetic operations.

## [Assignment 2: Decision Making Statements](Exercise%202)

- Objective: Demonstrate decision-making statements, including `if`, `if-else`, nested structures, and decision-making statements using `switch-case`.
- Contents: C code illustrating conditional statements and menu-driven programs.

## [Assignment 3: Loops](Exercise%203)

- Objective: Demonstrate the use of simple loops and nested loops.
- Contents: C programs showcasing loops, including `for`, `while`, and nested loops.

## [Assignment 4: Menu Driven Programs and Standard Library Functions](Exercise%204)
